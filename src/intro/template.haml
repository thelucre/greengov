				%p In 2012, Governor Brown <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17508" target="_blank">issued an executive order</a> requiring all state agencies to <strong>reduce greenhouse gas emissions</strong> by at least <strong>10%</strong> of their 2010 levels <strong>by 2015</strong>.  And by 2020, these reductions should be at 20%.
				%p The state is currently meeting and <strong>exceeding</strong> these targets as a whole.

							%div.about-units CO<sup>2</sup> emission units are 1000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Carbon Dioxide equivalent is determined by adding up emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O for each source, multiplying each source by its global warming potential (GWP) and summing these emissions into a single number.
