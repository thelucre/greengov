					%div.about-units CO<sup>2</sup> emission units are 1000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Carbon Dioxide equivalent is determined by adding up emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O for each source, multiplying each source by its global warming potential (GWP) and summing these emissions into a single number.
